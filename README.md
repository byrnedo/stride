# Stomp server poc

- [ ] Handle message format
- [ ] Sample message flow test with real world use cases
  - Needed for this:
    - test harness
      - run server
      - client to send messages (can be plain tcp client I guess?)
    - Example messages:
      - Connect and subscribe
      - Connect and publish
- [ ] Copy code from https://github.com/zslayton/stomp-rs, it's much better
